def fizzbuzz(n):
    """
    Implement the FizzBuzz game.

    Args:
        n (int): The maximum number to consider for the FizzBuzz game.

    Returns:
        str: A string containing the FizzBuzz output up to the given number n.

    The FizzBuzz game follows these rules:
    - For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
    - For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
    - For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
    - For all other numbers, print the number itself.

    The output should be a single string with each value separated by a newline character ('\n').

    Example:
        If n = 15, the expected output is:
        "1\n2\nFizz\n4\nBuzz\nFizz\n7\n8\nFizz\nBuzz\n11\nFizz\n13\n14\nFizzBuzz"
